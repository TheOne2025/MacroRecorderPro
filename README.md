# MacroRecorderPro

MacroRecorderPro demonstrates a simple WPF interface for a macro recording tool. The application replicates the layout shown in `MacroRecorderPro.html` and provides placeholder logic for recording and playback actions.

## Prerequisites

- **.NET 6 SDK** with Windows Desktop support. On Windows you can install it from the [official .NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0).

## Build and Run

1. Open a terminal in this directory.
2. Run `dotnet build` to compile the project.
3. Execute `dotnet run` to start the WPF application.

The commands above must be executed on a Windows machine with the .NET 6 SDK installed.

## HTML Mockup

The optional `MacroRecorderPro.html` file contains a web-based mockup of the interface. Open it in a browser if you want to preview the design outside of the WPF application.
